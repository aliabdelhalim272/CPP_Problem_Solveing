# CPP_Problem_Solveing
Welcome to my collection of C++ solutions for various coding problems! Here, I’ve solved a bunch of challenges across different topics like algorithms, data structures, and math. These solutions are a work in progress as I improve my problem-solving skills and dive deeper into C++.

### What You’ll Find:
• Solutions to common algorithm problems (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more).
• Implementations of basic and advanced data structures (like arrays, stacks, linked lists, trees, and graphs).
• Different problem-solving strategies I’ve explored (greedy, divide and conquer, backtracking, etc.).
• Efficient code that focuses on optimizing both time and space.

Feel free to check it out, try it for yourself, and let me know if you have suggestions or want to contribute!
